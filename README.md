# ThreadAM - Delta Onsite 2

There should be a timer running on the top of the screen. And there should be 6 wires in random order, (Red Blue Green , 2 wires each). Before the timer ends, the user has to rearrange them into a proper order. A proper order is when the same colors come one after the other. The timer should stop after the proper order is obtained.
